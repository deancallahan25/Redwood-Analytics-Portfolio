## Project Title
### Database for Zero Waste

## 1. Purpose & Context
- **Purpose:** Currently, Cal Poly Humboldt has an unrealiable waste audit data collection and storage system. The waste audit data is currently collected by various volunteers who record a few data points by hand about the waste. After it is collected, someone then creates a new waste audit each time, effectively meaning after the audit is presented, the data is not stored for future use. This not only is wasteful from a time perspective but also from any insights that could be gained by seeing larger campus-wide waste trends. While the data does provide many insights currently, having a more reliable and streamlined process that reduces subjectivity about data points, better visualizes the data, and stores this data properly will not only improve the insights gained from each audit but also the efficiency of each audit and their long term impact. 

- **Context:** From our meetings with Morgan King, we learned about various goals and challenges he has with the waste audits. 
goals identify problems with campus waste, raise awareness, reduce unneccessary waste on campus. 

Challenges, the data collection needs to be simple so he can easily train new volunteers to conduct the audits, waste practices change frequently the system needs to be able to be adjusted to account for changes. 

## 2. Systems to be Compared
 - **System A:** An Excel Spreadsheet data storage system
 - **System B:** An Oracle SQL relational database storage system 

## 3. Evalation Criteria & Methods

## 4. Sample Implementations to be Built
- **Spreadsheet Prototype:** Data will be entered into a Google Form and will then be exported to a Excel spreadsheet. 
- **Database Prototype:** Data will be entered into a website using various web applications and then entered into an Oracle SQL database schema.

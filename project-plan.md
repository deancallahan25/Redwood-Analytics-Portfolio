## Project Title - Database for Zero Waste

## 1. Purpose & Context
- **Purpose:** Currently, Cal Poly Humboldt has an unrealiable waste audit data collection and storage system. The waste audit data is currently collected by various volunteers who record a few data points by hand about the waste. After it is collected, someone then creates a new waste audit each time, effectively meaning after the audit is presented, the data is not stored for future use. This not only is wasteful from a time perspective but also from any insights that could be gained by seeing larger campus-wide waste trends. While the data does provide many insights currently, having a more reliable and streamlined process that reduces subjectivity about data points, better visualizes the data, and stores this data properly will not only improve the insights gained from each audit but also the efficiency of each audit and their long term impact. 

- **Context:** From our meetings with Morgan King, we learned about various goals and challenges he has with the waste audits. King's main goals with the audits are to identify potential issues with the waste process, raise awareness about ways to reduce waste, and to ultimately reduce the amount of waste on campus. King's main challenges with the waste audits are he uses volunteers so the data collection needs to be simple so they can be easily trained to conduct the audits and the fact that waste practices change frequently in the county.

## 2. Systems to be Compared
 - **System A:** An Excel Spreadsheet data storage system
 - **System B:** An Oracle SQL relational database storage system 

## 3. Evalation Criteria & Methods
1. Ease of Setup
2. Ease of Use for Auditors (new and experienced)
3. Error Prevention / Data Quality
4. Ability to Handle Relationships
5. Scalability & Performance
6. Reporting & Analysis
7. Integration with Campus IT
8. Cost (Total Cost of Ownership)
9. Maintenance After Setup

## 4. Sample Implementations to be Built
- **Spreadsheet Prototype:** Data will be entered into a Google Form and will then be exported to a Excel spreadsheet. 
- **Database Prototype:** Data will be entered into a website using various web applications and then entered into an Oracle SQL database schema. 

## 5. Data to be Collected for the Trial
- What sample data will you enter? We will use our recorded data from our audit we conducted on 9/11. If we need more data or we decide we want to collect other data points, we may conduct another audit. 
- How will you deliberately try bad data to test error prevention? We will test data that we know may cause errors like wrong input types, illogical values, and more to test for possible errors with our system.

## 6. Roles & Responsibilities
- **Tech Lead:** Set up the two data storage systems, troubleshoot both systems, improve user experience with data input
- **Project Manager:**
- **Domain Expert:**
- **Quality Assurance:**
